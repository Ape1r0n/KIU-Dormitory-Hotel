# Dormitory Hotel at KIU

This project was done as a final project for "Scripting Languages 2024" at Kutaisi International University using HTML/CSS and React/JS. 
I believe this project was more exciting since I did what is commonly referred to as "მატრაკვეცობა" in Georgian.
I spent quite some time choose color scheme of the website, design of each and every box, fonts, cursors(I did not know this was possible a priori) and most importantly, the main idea itself:
Renting KIU dorms as hotel rooms. All the people in the pictures are my friends in their rooms.
